# Multi-class-classifier-that-successfully-classifies-the-images-of-the-Fashion-MNIST-dataset.
Image classification is one of the most fundamental problems in Machine Learning. It is the core foundation for bigger problems such as Computer Vision,Face Recognition System,or self-driving car.There are many classification models that can be used for this task;however,it is important for student to fully understand the concepts of each model, and how they perform on different dataset. This goal of this project is to build a performant multi-class classifier that successfully classifies the images of the Fashion-MNIST dataset.Comprised of five categories of grayscale images (28 x 28), the Fashion-MNIST dataset consists of 10,000 training images and 5,000 test samples which is provided with the assignment. In this project,we will explore and study two classification models and compare their performance on grayscale images. The two classifiers are : • Kernal SVM Classifier. • Multilayer perceptrons MLPs When building a machine learning model, the correct data preparation and preprocessing is just as important as creating the classification model itself.Prior to any optimization or training of subsequent classification models, the Fashion-MNIST dataset needed to be read in and re-shaped before any additional pre-processing steps were carried out.
